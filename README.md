# Task7 Breast Cancer SVM Classifier
This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for binary classification of breast cancer tumors. It focuses on distinguishing malignant and benign cases using two core features for clarity and visualization.
# Features Used:
radius_mean
texture_mean
Label: diagnosis (encoded: Malignant = 1, Benign = 0)
# Objectives
Train and evaluate SVM with linear and RBF kernels.
Visualize decision boundaries in 2D.
Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Assess model performance with accuracy and cross-validation
# Key Components
Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Training with linear and non-linear kernels.
Visualization of decision regions.
Grid search for optimal C and gamma values.
Performance reporting with cross-validation and test set accuracy.
# Results
Optimal SVM configuration using RBF kernel.
Clear separation boundaries in visual plots.
High accuracy across test set and cross-validation.
